### **Personalized Negotiation Script**

---

**Introduction:**

*"Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my role, performance, and the value I bring to our company, as well as to outline my future career aspirations and how they align with our company's strategic goals."*

---

**1. Current Role and Achievements:**

*"Over the past year, I have worked as a Manual QA Engineer on the Pelvital and RBC projects. Although my primary role has been focused on manual QA, I have proactively pursued certifications in QA Automation, an area where I am passionate and skilled. During this time, I have also taken the initiative to integrate automation and AI into my work where possible, resulting in measurable improvements in our testing processes."*

**2. Market Research and Salary Benchmarks:**

*"In preparation for this discussion, I conducted thorough market research to understand the current salary benchmarks for QA Automation Engineers, both locally and internationally. In Paraguay, the average salary for a QA Automation Engineer is between PYG 9,000,000 and PYG 12,000,000 per month, with a premium for roles that involve advanced automation or AI skills. However, internationally, particularly in the United States, salaries range from USD 74,605 to USD 91,482 annually, which converts to approximately PYG 45,000,000 to PYG 55,000,000 monthly."* 

*"This data highlights a significant disparity between local and international salaries for these specialized roles, underscoring the high demand and value of QA professionals with automation and AI expertise."*

---

**3. Strategic Contributions and Future Goals:**

*"Given the company's current challenges in finding qualified QA professionals locally, particularly those with ISTQB certification and QA automation expertise, my skills and certifications position me as a crucial asset to the team. For example, the company had to relocate a highly experienced professional from India with over 25 years of experience, and another from Brazil, to fill roles that align with my capabilities. This demonstrates the scarcity of local talent and the importance of retaining and nurturing in-house expertise."*

*"Moving forward, my goal is to transition fully into a QA Automation Specialist role, where I can leverage my skills in automation and AI to drive efficiency and innovation. Additionally, I am eager to expand my responsibilities into DevOps, where I can contribute to setting up CI/CD pipelines and integrating automated testing frameworks. Ultimately, I envision myself taking on a leadership role in AI integration across departments, helping the company to harness AI for improved workflows and strategic advantage."*

---

**4. Salary Proposal and Justification:**

*"In light of my contributions, the specialized skills I bring, and the significant value I add to the company, I believe it is appropriate to discuss an adjustment to my current salary. I am proposing an increase to PYG 30,000,000 per month. This figure not only reflects the local market rates for QA Automation roles but also considers the premium for my advanced skills and the broader international benchmarks."*

*"Investing in my role aligns with the company's strategic goals of digital transformation, efficiency improvements, and innovation. By transitioning into a role that fully utilizes my automation and AI expertise, I can deliver even greater value, helping the company to meet its objectives more effectively and reducing the need for costly external hires."*

---

**Conclusion:**

*"I am committed to contributing to our company's success and growth. This proposed salary adjustment will empower me to continue developing my skills and make an even greater impact in my role. I look forward to your feedback and to working together to achieve our shared goals."*
