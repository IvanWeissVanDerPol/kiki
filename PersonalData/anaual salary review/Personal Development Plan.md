#### **4. Salary and Role Alignment**

**Current Salary:** PYG 10,000,000  
**Proposed Salary Increase:** PYG 30,000,000

**Justification:**
- **Skill Development:** Over the past year, I have invested significant time and resources in developing skills that are directly aligned with the company’s future needs in automation and AI. These skills are in high demand and have already begun to positively impact project outcomes.
- **Alignment with Company Goals:** My proposed career path directly supports key strategic initiatives such as digital transformation, efficiency improvements, and innovation through AI. By transitioning into roles that leverage my automation and AI expertise, I will be better positioned to contribute to these initiatives.
- **Value Addition:** Moving into an automation and AI-focused role will enable me to deliver greater value to the company, including faster testing cycles, higher quality products, and leadership in AI adoption. This transition not only enhances my contributions but also aligns with the company’s need to fill critical roles internally, reducing the need for costly external hires.
- **Addressing Talent Scarcity:** The company is currently facing significant challenges in finding qualified QA professionals locally, particularly those with ISTQB certification and QA automation expertise. This scarcity has necessitated the hiring of a super senior professional from India, with over 35 years of experience, and his relocation to Paraguay. Additionally, the company had to hire someone from Brazil to staff the RBC role, a position I secured on my first attempt. My skills and certifications allow me to fill these critical gaps internally, reducing reliance on costly external hires and providing continuity and expertise that is difficult to find in the local market.
- **Remote Work Preference and Additional Compensation for Office Work:** The RBC client has requested that I attend the office two times a week. However, my preference is to maintain remote work, as it allows me to focus better and contribute more effectively. Should I be required to work from the office, I would expect additional compensation to account for the increased costs and time associated with commuting. This additional compensation would be necessary to make office attendance a viable option for me, given my strong preference for remote work.
