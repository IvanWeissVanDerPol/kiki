  title: Experiences
  info:
    - role: Head of Development – Smart Beehive System
      time: 2023 – Early 2024
      company: T’Polleke Beekeeping (Family Collaboration – Netherlands)
      details: |
        - Designed and built a smart, self-regulating beehive during a visit to the Netherlands to assist a family-owned beekeeping business.
        - Aimed to optimize winter hive temperature to reduce bee energy expenditure on survival and increase honey production in spring.
        - Used an ESP32 microcontroller to collect and transmit sensor data, and to regulate heat output via an internal heating pad.
        - Installed four thermostats (one per corner) for distributed thermal readings and a humidity sensor to monitor hive climate conditions.
        - Collaborated with a senior programmer to evaluate and debate heating control strategies:
            - Considered a simple on/off threshold approach vs. dynamic voltage-based regulation.
            - Ultimately implemented a voltage-controlled system for smoother, more efficient thermal regulation.
        - Diagnosed multiple hardware issues:
            - Identified a batch of defective ESP32s (unresponsive to programming or rebooting); escalated to supplier and secured replacements.
            - Troubleshot a non-functional humidity sensor by testing pin continuity with a multimeter; discovered and replaced a poorly soldered unit.
        - Encountered Wi-Fi connectivity issues due to hive location; solved by deploying signal repeaters to enable real-time data transmission.
        - Created a live web dashboard to remotely monitor temperature and humidity metrics inside the hive.
        - Post-deployment results (tracked over 6 months by the beekeeper):
            - Significant increase in bee population through winter.
            - Doubling of honey production in spring compared to previous years.
